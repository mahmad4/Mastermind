My code does tries to figure out the combination within 5 attempts.

You have to press 1 to play 
then enter the number of positions and colors
Then enter the colors separated by a space(preferably letters)

The main method has mostly has prints out statements and calls the other methods:
1. Array:

Method that makes an array

2. Nextmove:
the next move method makes the next move which is basically the first element of the array.

3. update:
the update method compares the result with every element of the array and updates the array accordingly.


Have Fun playing!
